We looked into the context of traffic signalling, of which our current world relies so heavily on the use of colour to trigger reaction. Through explorations and quick prototyping of concepts, we turn to other non-colour based options, from visual effects to haptics, to re-design human behaviour.\n\nWe dived into the life and behaviour of someone living in such a fictional world, building the narrative and defining the parameters of what a colourless world would be. From there, we designed as designers in that world, and created a traffic signalling collection consisting of a re-conceptualized traffic cone, traffic light and speed bumps.\n","platform":{"id":"rec25nI6zwsfgpHgd","index":44},"designers":[{"id":"rec9y5P9VcUbudOfv","index":28}],"collaborators":"Clarissa Edeline Yu, Jonjoe Fong Jun Ming","images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2f1727e3638fa0a9d052505d59b5ec2e/9e8590f2?ts=1654212154&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=a555d7eab638ada5","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/970f4bb7711bc40c5d5de5480714b433/579f0373?ts=1654212154&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=df0720bf328e2c03","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/18b2cae09db9f8c8305c3c26958e7b2f/6045a0a9?ts=1654212154&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=de36751a99badb39","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bf990cc61e8387a1c12fd70983ef8bba/46232950?ts=1654212154&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=bd95664a77384372"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/994d0d68ca2893c061e3f0bbc5dc55d6/00f2dc8e/Achromatopia-Hero.jpg?ts=1654212154&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=2133f22c5a04bc4c","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b74be447fa83154c3e6347cda5ba1692/a14d29a5/1-Moire-Cone.jpg?ts=1654212154&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=76d9381d489a1ddf","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4932f7eb2e999703f54aa0e565ca98c0/08a5bc5b/2-Traffic-Light.jpg?ts=1654212154&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=0601bec94e4ca9ab","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b57a6d36b9da7ed6e4bfb20b08648d20/16dc0cfb/3-Gradient-Bump.jpg?ts=1654212154&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=5b2b5a7fdd7b72b7"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2f1727e3638fa0a9d052505d59b5ec2e/9e8590f2?ts=1654212154&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=a555d7eab638ada5","captions":["","The Moiré Traffic Cone generates a moiré optical illusion within the conical surface as the viewer walks across it (check out the phenomenon in the video link).

His works are held in private collections, as well as public permanent collections at the National Collection of Singapore; M+ Museum for Visual Culture, Hong Kong; and the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, New York. Hans has also actively engaged in curatorial work and has produced several exhibitions with a keen interest in the discursive capacity of design to engage public perceptions. His penchant for design pedagogy is guided by the concept of deformative inquiry, developing imaginative thinking tools that provide novel approaches to the design process based on generative deformations, use of language and systematic reflection.

controller does not normally come to mind. \n\nIf digital experiences are a mountain, conventional controllers are elevators to reach the peak. However you could also drive, hike, or take a cable car up the mountain, which are experiences in themselves. This project investigates how controls affect our relationship with game worlds thus our experiences with them, through the space of alternative control games. Even for a single interaction, like jumping, the way we input that jump in physical reality can drastically change the meanings it can have. This space is an opportunity to design new game experiences around controllers.\n\n«Press What? to Jump» is the expression of this exploration, a game about swapping between different alternative controllers for the same action. Through this the player samples the experience of designing alternative controls and understanding the nuances that each controller gives the same interaction.\n","keywords":"Experience, Speculative, Exploratory\n","gradsite":true,"designers":[{"id":"recGBguxAAlSCmG9t","index":47}],"supervisors":[{"id":"recT9JlcC0pm8IbtB","index":3}],"images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/93ad944d05eb23b7e9bff09de7739ed7/395ee295?ts=1654212155&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=f038fd50eb43e746","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/17aac0bd14f5e19729b239797b777eb6/91f8447d?ts=1654212155&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=41aefd174b3f1d59","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0c56d86fa0118c71ea974baa8bd663bd/0696694c?ts=1654212155&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=279c40236e45c339","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6052de0115214bb801a3bd47dec6a3f8/96bfc369?ts=1654212155&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=2c32bbcc6ae725d1"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/35251cd28d5e8926a718dfadfcd7b585/973cdc09/hero.png?ts=1654212155&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=dc6d218c5ae4d985","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/650b4cd910624c075b5b0b14c65f91ff/2237e4b5/thesis1.png?ts=1654212155&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=ec6f7c1f116ad744","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8eb856aa8bd6dcbb63a3020c8d34a256/873307cd/thesis2.png?ts=1654212155&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=5cb7da3c938604d4","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f0faebfef765b107eeb5f829fabb7dea/5696475e/thesis3.png?ts=1654212155&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=7fd50519ccba1679"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/93ad944d05eb23b7e9bff09de7739ed7/395ee295?ts=1654212155&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=f038fd50eb43e746","captions":["","The 2 player game is a simple race where players only jump.
