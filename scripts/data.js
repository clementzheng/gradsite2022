He deploys design as medium, making use of utility as a pretext for visual discourse, while maintaining a keen focus in developing materials and processes. The embedded narratives in his works comment on design and its industry as a phenomenon, especially in the context of heritage, consumption and waste. His works have been shown in exhibitions such as “Singletown” at the Venice Biennale, “Surface art/design” in Dortmund and Cologne, “Beauty” at the Cooper Hewitt Design Triennial, Smithsonian Design Museum New York, and “Local Icons East/West” at MAXXI Museo, Rome. He is a two-time winner of Design of the Year at the President's Design Award, Singapore's highest design accolade. His works are held in private collections, as well as public permanent collections at the National Collection of Singapore; M+ Museum for Visual Culture, Hong Kong; and the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, New York. Hans has also actively engaged in curatorial work and has produced several exhibitions with a keen interest in the discursive capacity of design to engage public perceptions. His penchant for design pedagogy is guided by the concept of deformative inquiry, developing imaginative thinking tools that provide novel approaches to the design process based on generative deformations, use of language and systematic reflection. The student works developed under his supervision has garnered many international awards, and he is a three-time winner of the NUS Annual Excellent Teaching Award.\n","portrait":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/916d883fb19c0ab02f48f74db6c8a80f/bd41a0df/Hans_Tan_v3.jpg?ts=1653961669&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=4215da50b9e3a930","thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e76fa978a60bb53a6abc5c8daa3c22a9/9e769754?ts=1653961669&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=1ba6c51ae0508e74","email":"hans@nus.edu.sg","link":"https://hanstan.net/","platforms":[{"id":"recAV4nYxdYomj4T9","index":2},{"id":"recDDWRO1WcHneotE","index":37},{"id":"recRvYINQzpCzZNhe","index":50},{"id":"rec0OzteP5gigq7tP","index":77},{"id":"recoHhsXsL7i9RcnJ","index":100},{"id":"recm8lrYmJGKUvLTn","index":116},{"id":"rec8A4HoMecvFfu0v","index":117}],"thesis":[{"id":"recVV6GSnWTGWHlbQ","index":39},{"id":"recuY14V2hnKVxbT4","index":24},{"id":"reckXCpGUQg0jFDw3","index":29},{"id":"recUrEopAFnsGybuo","index":14},{"id":"rec778SZhj32lBLV8","index":12},{"id":"recalvDKLqSjFXN87","index":13}],"active":"Actively teaching","position":"Full Time","order":2,"imageNames":["recuASntmmDCKQFId_0.jpeg"]},{"id":"recDyMJ3kM1DtHkTF","name":"Lee Jung-Joo","bio":"JJ has expertise in Service Design, Human-Centered Design, Co-Design and User Experience Design.

controller does not normally come to mind. \n\nIf digital experiences are a mountain, conventional controllers are elevators to reach the peak. However you could also drive, hike, or take a cable car up the mountain, which are experiences in themselves. This project investigates how controls affect our relationship with game worlds thus our experiences with them, through the space of alternative control games. Even for a single interaction, like jumping, the way we input that jump in physical reality can drastically change the meanings it can have. This space is an opportunity to design new game experiences around controllers.\n\n«Press What? to Jump» is the expression of this exploration, a game about swapping between different alternative controllers for the same action.
