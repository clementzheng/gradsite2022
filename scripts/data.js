This resonates with the very idea of lattice structures, where every subtle detail in the lattice’s geometry contributes to its eventual functionality and value. Instead of targeting multiple product features for a single function, a well-designed lattice - when applied in a product - can bring about multiple benefits within a single feature. The earliest examples include megastructures like the Eiffel Tower (1887), whereas today, additively manufactured meso and micro-scale lattice structures are widely used in the medical industry. This platform explores geometries for various small-scale applications.\n","leaders":[{"id":"reco9eMQu4LZ2D88k","index":24}],"projects":[{"id":"recHWM3WgYqZmPpcY","index":349},{"id":"recoldrIzkFBrxF14","index":348},{"id":"recFj697dT4P5br7x","index":347}],"specialization":["Product Innovation"]},{"id":"recQRtXG7keYwPcZN","name":"Machine Learning for Design","date":"2018-01-01","description":"Machine Learning for Design is a platform to explore how the latest machine learning technologies can serve as a design tool to improve our quality of life.

controller does not normally come to mind. \n\nIf digital experiences are a mountain, conventional controllers are elevators to reach the peak. However you could also drive, hike, or take a cable car up the mountain, which are experiences in themselves. This project investigates how controls affect our relationship with game worlds thus our experiences with them, through the space of alternative control games. Even for a single interaction, like jumping, the way we input that jump in physical reality can drastically change the meanings it can have. This space is an opportunity to design new game experiences around controllers.\n\n«Press What? to Jump» is the expression of this exploration, a game about swapping between different alternative controllers for the same action. Through this the player samples the experience of designing alternative controls and understanding the nuances that each controller gives the same interaction.\n","keywords":"Experience, Speculative, Exploratory\n","gradsite":true,"designers":[{"id":"recGBguxAAlSCmG9t","index":43}],"supervisors":[{"id":"recT9JlcC0pm8IbtB","index":3}],"images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/93ad944d05eb23b7e9bff09de7739ed7/395ee295?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=64748eed72de4dca","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/17aac0bd14f5e19729b239797b777eb6/91f8447d?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=df27d4a3c4c5f7af","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0c56d86fa0118c71ea974baa8bd663bd/0696694c?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=f4737778bde3e072","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6052de0115214bb801a3bd47dec6a3f8/96bfc369?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=2c0b4e1d08cba746"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/35251cd28d5e8926a718dfadfcd7b585/973cdc09/hero.png?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=e38f1342cf824503","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/650b4cd910624c075b5b0b14c65f91ff/2237e4b5/thesis1.png?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=4b047141a92023fc","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8eb856aa8bd6dcbb63a3020c8d34a256/873307cd/thesis2.png?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=72ce5544fed336f4","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f0faebfef765b107eeb5f829fabb7dea/5696475e/thesis3.png?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=f322f9afecdff893"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/93ad944d05eb23b7e9bff09de7739ed7/395ee295?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=64748eed72de4dca","captions":["","The 2 player game is a simple race where players only jump.

Designed like a typeface, it embodies the expression of a language that binds different culinary traditions—from the Western knives and wine glasses, to the Chinese chopsticks and tea set. Each piece dialogues gracefully with one another, refined to work in concert and in any combination.\n\nBy practising typographic instincts (e.g. light, regular, and bold weights according to the sequence of placement), the collection behaves like an alphabet of objects that harmonises your dining and storage experience. All made with traditional materials then finished in black, each item is like a letter to be composed on a page of white.\n","keywords":"Product, Experience, Exploratory","gradsite":true,"designers":[{"id":"recguV38T0cmTnLzM","index":15}],"supervisors":[{"id":"recee8zPyZUohrFv5","index":2}],"images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/74e18a8ee0e08c9882266cfae3eb9516/924657f3?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=8ef993163a80fd88","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9f7448afcb982f6e8a1da89c3a8c4b1c/1f96e636?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=6800aef7b3655026","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e3259d11227f06fe801d15e3c549418f/673a7cf1?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=8fa913a6914183be","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2ad9ffed9db4808a2c1721efacb4eb3d/44ad28d5?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=c14a5ec77fd781f4","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/60a03fb61896032f99abca4aaf3708d9/77738bb1?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=a0b4127d4000f554","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0f4e97d84036d4ea7a9e55720b53c64d/392f5d38?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=d3dfcf23d917dbd8"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/69d50e32ee038aa9a25940d676662361/7b8e1a19/hero-image.png?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=4163de31bf9032d3","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0c0d87859ab014406a2528f9691559c1/d77f7f8f/on-table.png?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=1f7dae9afd74598f","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/43bc9d221da25ed722f814c3c21248e8/fcfd1c5f/silverware-alignment-3.png?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=6c13817f6bf08328","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/2545eaf2b5e0c1c39a91d014e9d5b10a/c9daf8d4/on-shelf.png?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=d2eada4aa1b6de7b","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8049a42ddd621e5885858f5dde01efc0/413aa66f/typography-lines.png?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=d0ed474a3cff9349","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0bd1319f258b876fe6f5f1501e69de0e/0dd1b957/product-journey-final-2.gif?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=d142b488c4e837a2"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/74e18a8ee0e08c9882266cfae3eb9516/924657f3?ts=1653898206&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=8ef993163a80fd88","captions":["","On the table, Dine Serif complements the art of table setting by adopting typographic details to intuitively guide users.","With the ‘serif’ detail right at the midpoint of all silverware, users are able to neatly align and space them apart with ease.
